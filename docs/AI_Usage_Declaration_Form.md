## AI Tool Usage Summary

**Did you use any AI tools for this assignment?** [v] Yes [ ] No

If yes, please provide a brief summary of your AI usage:

### AI Tools Used

- **Tool 1:** ChatGPT
- **Tool 2:** [Tool name - if applicable]
- **Tool 3:** [Tool name - if applicable]

### Summary of AI Assistance

**What did you use AI for?** debugging, learning concepts

```
[Provide a brief summary of how you used AI tools in your project development]
I encountered a problem while writing the code to delete image labels. 
After being alerted by GPT, I discovered that two places in the code were using "labelID" and "ID" respectively, 
which caused the deletion issue. Changing them to "ID" resolved the problem.

After completing the basic functionality, I considered adding code for automatic label classification,
but after some research, I got a bit lazy and didn't add that feature.
```

**What percentage of your code was AI-generated?**

- [ ] Less than 10%
- [v] 10-25%
- [ ] 25-50%
- [ ] 50-75%
- [ ] More than 75%

**How did you modify and integrate AI-generated code?**

```
[Briefly explain how you adapted AI-generated content to fit your project]
```

**Understanding Check:**
**Can you explain how the AI-generated code works?** (e.g., what each function does, how the logic flows, what the key concepts are)

```
[Provide a brief explanation of how the AI-generated code works and why you chose to use it]
```

**Modification Evidence:**
**What changes did you make to the AI-generated code?** (e.g., variable names, logic adjustments, integration with your existing code)

```
[Briefly describe the specific modifications you made to adapt the AI code to your project]
```

## Additional External Assistance

**Online Resources Used:**

- [List any online tutorials, Stack Overflow posts, or documentation you used]
- [Include URLs and explain how they helped]

**Group Discussion Contributions:**

- [Describe any help received from group members]
- [Explain how group discussions influenced your code]

## Learning Reflection

**What did you learn from using AI tools?**

```
[Reflect on how AI tools helped you understand concepts or solve problems]
```

**What challenges did you face when integrating AI-generated code?**

```
[Describe any difficulties you encountered and how you overcame them]
```

**How did you ensure the final code was your own work?**

```
[Explain your process for understanding and modifying AI-generated content]

We used AI only as a debugging assistant. 
During development, we refactored routes and helper functions, renamed variables, fixed database issues, and added missing functionality ourselves. 
We verified each feature through manual testing of CRUD operations, validating SQL queries, checking API responses, and observing how the front-end interacted with the back-end. 
All code was explained, rewritten, modified, and tested by us, so the final system reflects my personal understanding and unique contributions.
```
