### Test Data

The application includes sample data with:

- 3 users (admin, user1, user2)
- 3 categories (Work, Personal, Study)
- 10+ sample tasks with different statuses and priorities

## Known Issues and Limitations

3. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation for live updates
4. **Advanced Search**: Limited search functionality
5. **Mobile App**: No native mobile application

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**: Implement login/logout system
2. **File Attachments**: Allow file uploads for tasks
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Add WebSocket support
4. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options
5. **Mobile App**: Develop React Native or Flutter app
6. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
7. **Data Export**: Add CSV/PDF export functionality
